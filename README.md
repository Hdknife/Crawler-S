# Clawer-S

Welcome to the GitHub repository of **Clawer-Spider**! This software is designed for businesses and email marketing professionals. It works based on keywords, following a prompt-based structure, making it easy to use. Clawer-S includes five powerful tools to help you efficiently extract contacts using keywords.

## Tools

1. **Keywords Extractor**  
   The Keywords Extractor works by entering a keyword, such as a company name. After clicking the start button, the software gathers contacts within a short time and displays the extracted emails.

2. **Map Extractor**  
   The Map Extractor retrieves data from maps quickly and efficiently. While it does not extract emails, it gathers other contact details such as names and phone numbers.

3. **URL Extractor**  
   The URL Extractor allows users to extract contact details by simply entering a URL.

4. **Text Extractor**  
   The Text Extractor scans and extracts contact information from raw text.

5. **Email Map Extractor**  
   The most powerful tool in Clawer-S, the Email Map Extractor, collects complete contact details, including emails, phone numbers, descriptions, names, social media links, and addresses.

6. **AI Analysis Tool**  
   The AI Analysis Tool is designed to analyze contact details. Currently, it only supports **Gemini AI**.

- **Depth**: This option controls how many pages of a website the crawler will scrape. For example, if a website (`https://example.com`) has 5 pages and you want to scrape data from only 2 pages where you can find email addresses, set the depth to 2.

- **IP Address**: Use this option to add a proxy for untraceable scraping.

- **Gen AI API**: Visit Googleâ€™s Gemini AI API to get a free version. However, for large businesses, we recommend using the paid version for better performance. The API is a text string that you input into the Gen AI API option.
